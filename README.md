### Operating Systems' project

This repo holds a project for Operating Systems course. In this project our work was to implement a system of ordering and delivery pizzas using the POSIX threads (pthreads) package. Orders are placed in this system by phone, paid by card, each order is prepared, packaged and finally delivered to the customer. In these systems we have a large number of orders that served by a limited number of service points, so our programm had to implement mutual exclusion (with mutexes) and synchronization (with condition variables).
